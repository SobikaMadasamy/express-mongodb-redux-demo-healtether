HealTether Task Demo
This repository contains the code for Task 1 and Task 2 as part of the HealTether interview process. The tasks demonstrate the implementation of Express validation, MongoDB integration, and Redux state management in a Node.js and React application.

Task 1
Implemented Express validation, forms, and integrated a MongoDB database.
Used packages such as bcrypt, JSON Web Token (JWT), validator, and mongoose to handle data validation, security, and authentication.
On the front end, React hooks were used for enhanced functionality.

Task 2
Used Redux-React for state management.
Redux is used to efficiently handle and update the applicationâ€™s state, providing a robust solution for large-scale state management in React applications.
